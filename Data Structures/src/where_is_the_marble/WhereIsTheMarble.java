 * Where is the Marble?
 * By Monirul Hasan Tomal, SEU Bangladesh
 * 
 * Timelimit: 2
 * Raju and Meena love to play with Marbles. They have a lot of marbles with
 * numbers written on them. In the beginning, Raju would place the marbles one
 * after another in ascending order of the numbers written on them. Then, Meena
 * would ask Raju to find the first marble with a certain number. She would
 * count 1...2...3. Raju gets one point for correct answer, and Meena gets the
 * point if Raju fails. After some fixed number of attempts, the game ends and
 * the player with maximum points wins. Today it's your chance to play as Raju.
 * Being a smart kid, you have in your advantage the computer. But don't
 * underestimate Meena, she wrote a program to keep track how much time you're
 * taking to give all the answers. So now you have to write a program, which
 * will help you in your role as Raju.
 * 
 * Input
 * There can be multiple test cases. The total number of test cases is less than
 * 65. Each test case consists begins with 2 integers: N the number of marbles
 * and Q the number of queries Meena would make. The next N lines would contain
 * the numbers written on the N marbles. These marble numbers will not come in
 * any particular order. Following Q lines will have Q queries. Be assured, none
 * of the input numbers are greater than 10000 and none of them are negative.
 * 
 * Input is terminated by a test case where N = 0 and Q = 0.
 * 
 * Output
 * For each test case output there must be a serial number of the test case. For
 * each query, write one line of output. The format of this line will depend on
 * whether the number is consulted or not written in one of the marbles.
 * 
 * The two different formats are described below:
 * 'x found at y', if the first marble with number x was found at position y.
 * Positions are numbered 1, 2,..., N.
 * 'x not found', if the marble with number x is not present.
 * 
 * Input Sample
 * 4 1
 * 2
 * 3
 * 5
 * 1
 * 5
 * 5 2
 * 1
 * 3
 * 3
 * 3
 * 1
 * 2
 * 3
 * 0 0
 * 
 * Output Sample
 * 
 * CASE# 1:
 * 5 found at 4
 * CASE# 2:
 * 2 not found
 * 3 found at 3
